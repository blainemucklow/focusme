## White-Space Opportunity Summary

**NO existing product in 2025 combines:**
1. **Meeting intent modeling** (must-have vs optional participants, flexible vs fixed)
2. **Elastic, priority-aware scheduling** with automatic reshuffling based on participant importance
3. **Unified reasoning** across calendar, email, notes, and actions in one intelligent system
4. **Continuous focus guidance** based on outcome importance and participant priority
5. **Meeting relationship tracking** (parent/child meetings, prep time, follow-ups that move together)
6. **Contextual preparation** (AI notes integration, last-interaction summaries for meeting prep)
7. **ADHD-optimized UX** (reduced cognitive load, visual priority cues, reminder fatigue prevention)

**FocusMe's Unique Position:** An orchestration layer that sits above existing tools (Outlook, Google Calendar) and actively manages the workday with intelligence that current tools lack.
